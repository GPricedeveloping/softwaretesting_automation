In my college projects, I worked on the developing and testing of a mobile application with features like contact management, task tracking, and appointment scheduling. To ensure these features were functional and reliable, I used unit testing to validate each part of the code. This involved testing individual units and verifying that they worked correctly, using techniques like boundary value analysis to check input limits and equivalence partitioning to cover diverse scenarios. My goal was to ensure that the software met the requirements and handled various situations effectively.

I made sure to create software that meets user needs, I focused on understanding the requirements and translating them into specific features. I tested these features thoroughly to make sure they worked as expected. In designing software, I emphasized caution and precision, testing for potential edge cases and collaborating with colleagues to catch any issues I might have missed. By sticking to strict testing protocols and avoiding shortcuts, I aimed to deliver high-quality, reliable software that meets the needs of users and performs well in various conditions.
